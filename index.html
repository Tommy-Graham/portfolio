        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Approximately 1 million years ago - or so it seems -, in the Before Times, I moved from a small, nondiscript
            village in the Midlands, to a city in the North West of England. I did so to study art, as was my want. 
            After graduating, I got myself a studio and worked for years as a painter, illustrator and cartoonist for 
            galleries, publications and private clients. I subsidised this when needed, with various different jobs in 
            hospitality such as bar tender or Front of House Supervisor. Fast forward to today, and I still live in the 
            North West, in a lovely little mid-terrace, with my Wife, our two dogs and an emotionally disturbed cat. You're
            welcome to pop round and say hello, but do ring in advance, just to make sure we're in. 
           </p>

        <p> After years of working as an illustrator and cartoonist, the world finally became weirder and more 
            outlandish than anything you could successfully relay through parody, and I decided to change career. 
            The idea of becoming a developer appealed to me as - through my various incarnations in art and design 
            - I've aqcuired a skillset I can use in a completely different field. I also relish a challenge and like 
            to push myself in to learning new things, so coding seemed like an ideal fit. Additionally, I must 
            have seen the 1995 film 'Hackers' like 15 times, which may have had some residual influence on my 
            decision at a subconscious level. </p>

                    The giant anamorphic bird was designed to be visable from only one angle and took five days to paint.
