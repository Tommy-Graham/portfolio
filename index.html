        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>After years of working as an illustrator and cartoonist, the world finally became weirder and more outlandish than anything you could successfully relay through parody, and I decided to change career.</p>
        <p> The idea of becoming a developer appeals to me as - through my various incarnations as an Artist, Illustrator, Graphic Designer and Cartoonist - I have acquired a skillset that I can apply to a completely different field.</p>
        <p>Also, I must have seen the 1995 film 'Hackers' like 15 times, which may have had some residual influence on my decision at a subconscious level.</p>
